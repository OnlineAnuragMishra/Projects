# Cyberbully Tweet Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains the codebase for a machine learning project titled "Cyberbully Tweet Classifier." The project aims to develop an AI model for the classification and detection of cyberbullying tweets, contributing to the creation of a safer online environment.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the classifier.
- **notebooks/**: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **src/**: Directory containing Python scripts for the implementation of feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- **reports/**: Directory containing project reports summarizing methodologies, findings, and challenges.
- **requirements.txt**: File specifying the Python dependencies required to run the code.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/OnlineAnuragMishra/Projects.git
2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
4. Run the Python scripts in the `src/` directory to train and evaluate the classifier on your dataset.
5. Refer to the project reports in the `reports/` directory for detailed insights and findings.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of cyberbullying tweets collected from various sources on the internet. It contains text data along with corresponding labels indicating whether each tweet is cyberbullying or not.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the classifier is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Various machine learning algorithms are explored, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
